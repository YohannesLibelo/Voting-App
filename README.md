# Project Name

This project is a MERN for e-voting web app.

## introduction

The project aims to develop an online election platform to enhance accessibility, inclusivity, and transparency in the electoral process. By digitalizing elections, we can streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve trust in the system. This platform will allow registered voters to sign up, cast their votes, and view real-time poll results. With the use of modern technologies, we aim to create a robust and secure platform that aligns with global sustainability goals.
## features

- User authentication using JWT for secure access to protected routes.
- CRUD operations on resources, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
- Integration of MongoDB for storing application data and Express.js for building RESTful APIs.
- Frontend development with React.js for building interactive user interfaces.
- Implementation of best practices for folder structure, code organization, and scalability.

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Yohannes10/votingapp

2.Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd your-project/client

3. Install dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npm start

5. npm start

6. The frontend server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.



Backend Setup:
1. cd your-project/server
2. npm install
3. Start the development server: nodemon app.js

MongoDB Setup:
Install MongoDB if not already installed on your system.
